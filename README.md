A new Flutter project. You need to install, then you can move on.

## Getting Started

Run this commands to start a project

- `flutter pub get`
- `flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs`
- And then add your api key in **/lib/api/stock_api_constant.dart**, there is no flavors/env in this project, so you have to do it manually like this.
